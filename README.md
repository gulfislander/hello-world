# hello-world
just a trial repository
I am a retired economist, statistician and technical writer. I started programming on an IBM 1401 in 1966 at IBM in Toronto. I have dabbled in programming for my own purposes since then. I took a Certificate in VB from UC San Diego in 1999 in order to build some econometric models. I am installing an Endless Pool in my house and want to build a controller for it rather than buy one for $1200.
